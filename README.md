</div>

**RepX** is a lightweight reputation system built in C++ with a terminal-based navigation UI.

It records reputation through controlled, encrypted entries and generates transparent leaderboards from accumulated data. RepX follows a strict no-modification philosophy. Scores are never edited, every change is appended through structured logic, preserving a tamper-resistant history.

RepX ensures accountability, integrity, and trust by design - not by assumption.


<div align="center">

## **The Problem & The Vision**
</div>

Most reputation systems focus on scoring. RepX focuses on accountability.

RepX treats reputation like a ledger. All of this data is encrypted and stored in a controlled `repboard.json`, accessible only through RepX.

<div align="center">

|    **Typical Reputation Systems**     |                **RepX**                 |
| :-----------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: |
|        Scores can be modified         | Scores are never edited - only appended |
|         Reasons are optional          |   Reason is mandatory for every entry   |
|          History is unclear           |    Every entry records who and when     |
| Reputers operate without traceability |     Reputers are fully accountable      |
|       Bias is hard to challenge       |  Entries are verifiable and reviewable  |

</div>

Because every entry is traceable, the system enables :
- Validation of reputation claims.
- Publicly verifiable reasoning.
- Log generation from stored data.
- Robust structure to prevent silent manipulations.

> Trust is enforced by architecture - not authority.

## **Who Is RepX For?**
</div>

RepX is built for any environment where reputation matters and accountability is important.

It can be used by :
- **Teachers** - tracking student performance or conduct
- **Employers** - evaluating employee contributions
- **Event hosts** - conducting competitive scoring systems
- **Community organizers** - running transparent leaderboards
- **Team leads** - monitoring developer productivity
- **Project maintainers** - managing open-source contributors

RepX is universal by design.
If someone can earn reputation, RepX can record it.

## **Why RepX?**
</div>

Reputation can be tracked in many ways - spreadsheets, Discord bots, LMS systems, HR tools, etc.
But most of them are built for convenience, not integrity.

<div align="center">

| **Others**                  | **RepX**                         |
| :-------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| Manual score editing        | No direct modification allowed   |
| Optional or missing reasons | Mandatory reason for every entry |
| Weak or no history tracking | Structured, traceable history    |
| Central authority control   | Transparent, verifiable entries  |
| Cloud/platform dependency   | Portable single executable       |
| Closed-source systems       | Fully open-source                |

</div>

RepX prioritizes structure over flexibility and accountability over convenience.

> It is not designed to be flashy. It is designed to be reliable.

## **Developer Section**
</div>

RepX is built as a modular, engine-style system - not as a monolithic script. The architecture emphasizes :
- Clear separation between core and modules
- Explicit state management
- Controlled global configuration
- Compile-time invariants where possible
- Minimal external dependencies

RepX avoids unnecessary abstraction and hidden state.
Every component has a defined responsibility.

### Design Principles :
- No silent mutations
- No accidental globals
- No direct score modification
- Architecture over convenience
- Structure over shortcuts

RepX treats reputation as infrastructure - not a feature.
